MODEL ANALYSIS RESULT
====================

Query: "Analyze urban development in this region over the past year"
Model: DeepSeek-Coder-Small
Deployment: Local (GPU)

ANALYSIS:
--------
The satellite imagery shows significant urban development in the northeastern 
quadrant of the region over the past 12 months. Specifically:

1. Construction of approximately 37 new residential buildings
2. Expansion of road network by 4.2 km
3. Reduction in vegetation cover by 3.1%
4. New commercial development near the highway intersection

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT:
-------------------
- Moderate reduction in permeable surfaces
- Potential increase in urban heat island effect
- Minimal impact on existing water bodies
- Loss of small woodland area (approximately 1.2 hectares)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
--------------
1. Monitor stormwater runoff in newly developed areas
2. Consider green infrastructure to mitigate heat island effect
3. Implement vegetation buffers around new developments
4. Preserve remaining natural areas to maintain ecological balance

CONFIDENCE SCORE: 87%
