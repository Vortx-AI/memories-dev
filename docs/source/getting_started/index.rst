Setting Up Your Earth Observatory
----------------------------

Before we dive into the technical components of The Memory Codex, we need to establish your development environment—what we call your **Earth Observatory**. This observatory will serve as your foundation for creating AI systems grounded in our planet's observable reality.

The Earth Observatory isn't simply a collection of libraries and tools—it's a comprehensive framework for perceiving, processing, and preserving Earth's state through various data streams and temporal scales.

Environment Setup
-------------

To begin building your Earth Observatory, you'll need to install the Memory Codex framework and its dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Create and activate a dedicated environment
   python -m venv earth-memory
   source earth-memory/bin/activate  # On Windows: earth-memory\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install the Memory Codex framework
   pip install memories-dev
   
   # Install additional Earth observation packages
   pip install memories-dev[earth]

The `[earth]` extension includes essential packages for working with geospatial data, satellite imagery, environmental metrics, and temporal analytics.

.. note::

   For specialized Earth observational capabilities like processing satellite imagery or climate data, you may need additional system dependencies. Check the :doc:`../installation/advanced` section for platform-specific instructions.

Verifying Installation
------------------

Once installed, verify your Earth Observatory is properly configured:

.. code-block:: python

   import memories
   
   # Check if Earth Memory components are available
   earth_capabilities = memories.diagnostics.check_earth_capabilities()
   print(earth_capabilities)
   
   # Output should include:
   # - Earth Memory Core: Available
   # - Geospatial Engine: Available
   # - Temporal Analysis: Available
   # - Satellite Integration: Available
   # - Sensor Networks: Available

Observatory Initialization
---------------------

Now, initialize your first Earth Observatory:

.. code-block:: python

   from memories.earth import Observatory
   
   # Create your observatory with default Earth observation sources
   observatory = Observatory(
       name="my-earth-observatory",
       observation_radius="global",  # Start with global scope
       temporal_range="present",     # Focus on current Earth state
       data_sources=["satellite", "environment", "climate"]
   )
   
   # Verify connectivity to Earth data sources
   observatory.test_connections()
   
   # Initialize the observatory
   observatory.initialize()

This creates a fully-configured Earth Observatory that can begin ingesting and processing planetary data. Your observatory is now connected to critical Earth observation sources, including satellite imagery, environmental sensors, and climate datasets.

Earth Memory Core Components
------------------------

The Memory Codex platform operates around several core components:

.. mermaid::

   graph TD
       A[Earth Observatory] --> B[Data Ingestion Engine]
       A --> C[Spatial Memory Store]
       A --> D[Temporal Memory Manager]
       A --> E[Observation Validator]

       style B fill:#184e77,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white
       style C fill:#1a759f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white

       style E fill:#184e77,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,color:white

1. **Data Ingestion Engine**: Connects to Earth observation sources, normalizes data formats, and prepares them for memory storage.

2. **Spatial Memory Store**: Organizes observations based on their geographic context and spatial relationships.

3. **Temporal Memory Manager**: Tracks Earth state changes across multiple time scales, from real-time to historical.

4. **Observation Validator**: Ensures data quality, verifies observations, and maintains scientific integrity.

Understanding these components is essential for building Earth-grounded AI applications. Each will be explored in detail in subsequent chapters.

Creating Your First Earth Memory
---------------------------

Let's create a simple Earth memory focused on the current state of forest cover:

.. code-block:: python

   # Import necessary components
   from memories.earth import Observatory, MemoryType, DataSource
   
   # Create observatory with focused observation area
   observatory = Observatory(
       name="forest-observatory",
       observation_radius="regional",  # Focus on specific regions
       center_coordinates=(37.7749, -122.4194),  # San Francisco area
       radius_km=500,  # Observe 500km radius
       data_sources=[DataSource.SATELLITE_IMAGERY]
   )
   
   # Create a forest cover memory
   forest_memory = observatory.create_memory(
       name="forest-cover-2025",
       memory_type=MemoryType.EARTH_FEATURE,
       feature_type="vegetation",
       resolution="30m",  # 30-meter resolution (Landsat)
       temporal_record=True,  # Track changes over time
       validation_level="high"  # Ensure scientific accuracy
   )
   
   # Retrieve the current forest state
   forest_state = forest_memory.get_current_state()
   
   # Display basic statistics about forest cover
   print(f"Forest area: {forest_state.area_km2} km²")
   print(f"Dominant species: {forest_state.dominant_species}")
   print(f"Health index: {forest_state.health_index}/10")
   print(f"Change over past year: {forest_state.annual_change_percent}%")

This simple example demonstrates how we can create an Earth memory that's directly connected to observable reality. Unlike traditional AI approaches that might simply retrieve text descriptions about forests, this memory is grounded in actual satellite measurements of forest cover.

Earth Memory Configuration
---------------------

The configuration file structure for an Earth Memory project follows a specific pattern that enables proper grounding in observational data. Here's a sample configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # earth_memory_config.yaml
   observatory:
     name: "global-earth-observer"
     description: "Planetary monitoring system with multi-modal sensing"
     
     data_sources:
       - name: "satellite"
         providers: ["landsat", "sentinel", "modis"]
         update_frequency: "daily"
         
       - name: "climate"
         providers: ["noaa", "ecmwf", "nasa"]
         update_frequency: "hourly"
         
       - name: "ground_sensors"
         providers: ["usgs", "wmo", "custom"]
         update_frequency: "realtime"
     
     memory_systems:
       - name: "hot_memory"
         retention_period: "7d"
         resolution: "high"
         
       - name: "warm_memory"
         retention_period: "1y"
         resolution: "medium"
         
       - name: "cold_memory"
         retention_period: "10y"
         resolution: "low"
         
       - name: "glacier_memory"
         retention_period: "100y+"
         resolution: "variable"
     
     validation:
       scientific_integrity: "enforced"
       source_tracking: "enabled"
       uncertainty_metrics: "required"
       observational_bounds: "strict"

This configuration establishes a robust Earth Memory system that maintains scientific integrity while providing comprehensive coverage of Earth's observable state.

.. note::

   As you continue through this codex, remember that each Earth Memory you create represents a true connection to our planet's state—not merely a statistical model of text about Earth, but a direct grounding in observable reality.

The Memory Codex opens an entirely new approach to artificial intelligence—one that's fundamentally tethered to Earth's physical truth. In the next chapter, we'll explore the core concepts behind Earth Memory and how they transform AI's relationship with our planet.
