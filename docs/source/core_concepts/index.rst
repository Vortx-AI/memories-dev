The core concepts of ``memories-dev`` are built around a scientific approach to Earth observation data and memory systems, with a focus on modularity, scalability, and performance.

Key Concepts Overview
-------------------

1. **Architecture**: The overall system architecture that enables the framework to process and analyze Earth observation data across multiple layers.

2. **Data Flow**: The comprehensive data flow architecture that transforms raw Earth observation data into actionable intelligence, from acquisition to delivery.

3. **Memory System**: The multi-tiered memory system that efficiently stores and retrieves data based on access patterns, importance, and relevance.

Together, these concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how ``memories-dev`` integrates Earth observation data with AI models to create a comprehensive memory system for our planet.
