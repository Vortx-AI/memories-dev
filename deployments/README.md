- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular access control for deployment management
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all deployment operations

## Deployment Patterns

### Standalone Deployment

The Standalone deployment pattern is designed for single-instance deployments where simplicity and ease of management are priorities.

    API --> Server[Memories Server]
    Server --> Models[Model System]
    Server --> DataAcq[Data Acquisition]
    Models --> LocalModels[Local Models]
    Models --> APIModels[API-based Models]
    DataAcq --> VectorData[Vector Data Sources]
    DataAcq --> SatelliteData[Satellite Data]
    Server --> Storage[Persistent Storage]
```

**Key Features:**
- Single-instance deployment
- Simplified management and configuration
- Suitable for development, testing, and small-scale production
- Supports all core functionality
- Easy scaling to other deployment patterns

### Consensus Deployment

The Consensus deployment pattern uses a distributed consensus algorithm to ensure high availability and data consistency across multiple nodes.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Client Applications] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> Node1[Node 1]
    LB --> Node2[Node 2]
    LB --> Node3[Node 3]
    
    subgraph "Consensus Group"
        Node1 <--> Node2
        Node2 <--> Node3
        Node3 <--> Node1
    end
    
    Node1 --> Models1[Model System]
    Node2 --> Models2[Model System]
    Node3 --> Models3[Model System]
    
    Node1 --> DataAcq1[Data Acquisition]
    Node2 --> DataAcq2[Data Acquisition]
    Node3 --> DataAcq3[Data Acquisition]
    
    subgraph "Shared Storage"
        Storage[Distributed Storage]
    end
    
    Node1 --> Storage
    Node2 --> Storage
    Node3 --> Storage
```

**Key Features:**
- Multi-node deployment with consensus algorithm
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Strong consistency guarantees
- Automatic leader election and failover
- Suitable for mission-critical applications

### Swarmed Deployment

The Swarmed deployment pattern uses a container orchestration system to manage a large number of nodes, providing high scalability and resilience.

```mermaid
graph TD
    Client[Client Applications] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API1[API Gateway 1]
    LB --> API2[API Gateway 2]
    LB --> API3[API Gateway 3]
    
    subgraph "Manager Nodes"
        Manager1[Manager 1]
        Manager2[Manager 2]
        Manager3[Manager 3]
        
        Manager1 <--> Manager2
        Manager2 <--> Manager3
        Manager3 <--> Manager1
    end
    
    API1 --> Manager1
    API2 --> Manager2
    API3 --> Manager3
    
    subgraph "Worker Nodes"
        Worker1[Worker 1]
        Worker2[Worker 2]
        Worker3[Worker 3]
        Worker4[Worker 4]
        Worker5[Worker 5]
    end
    
    Manager1 --> Worker1
    Manager1 --> Worker2
    Manager2 --> Worker3
    Manager2 --> Worker4
    Manager3 --> Worker5
    
    subgraph "Shared Services"
        Registry[Container Registry]
        Config[Configuration Store]
        Secrets[Secrets Management]
        Monitoring[Monitoring & Logging]
    end
    
    Manager1 --> Registry
    Manager1 --> Config
    Manager1 --> Secrets
    Manager1 --> Monitoring
```

**Key Features:**
- Container-based deployment with orchestration
- Highly scalable and elastic
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- Suitable for large-scale, dynamic workloads

## Troubleshooting

### Standalone Deployment Issues
- **Connection Refused**: Check that the server is running and the firewall allows connections
- **Out of Memory**: Increase the instance size or enable swap
- **Slow Performance**: Enable GPU support or increase CPU allocation

### Consensus Deployment Issues
- **Split Brain**: Ensure quorum size is set correctly (n/2 + 1)
- **Node Failure**: Check network connectivity and instance health
- **Consensus Timeout**: Adjust timeout settings in the configuration

### Swarmed Deployment Issues
- **Container Crashes**: Check logs for error messages
- **Scaling Issues**: Verify autoscaling configuration
